            for Microsoft Windows built with free software components from Apple WebKit and Mozilla
            Firefox.[12] It was later ported to Linux, macOS, iOS, and Android where it is the default browser
            built into the OS.[13] The browser is also the main component of Chrome OS, where it serves as the platform for web applications.

            Firefox Browser, also known as Mozilla Firefox or simply Firefox, is a free and open-source[22]
            web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation.
            Firefox uses the Gecko rendering engine to display web pages.[23] In 2017, Firefox began
            incorporating new technology under the code name Quantum to promote parallelism and a more
            intuitive user interface.[24] Firefox is available for Windows 7 or Windows 10, macOS, and Linux.
            Its unofficial ports are available for various Unix and Unix-like operating systems including
            FreeBSD,[7] OpenBSD,[8] NetBSD,[9] illumos,[10] and Solaris Unix.[12] Firefox is also available
            for Android and iOS. However, the iOS version uses the WebKit layout engine instead of Gecko due
            to platform requirements, as with all other iOS web browsers. An optimized version of Firefox is also
            available on the Amazon Fire TV, as one of the two main browsers available with Amazon's Silk Browser.[25]
